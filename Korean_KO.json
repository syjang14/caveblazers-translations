    "m_lslime_desc": "These larger, more mature slimes are much tougher to deal with. They are often seen carrying a skull of one of their previous victims - it is thought that this is an attempt to strike fear in to any nearby threats. When slimes grow to this size, they can be seen to split in half, creating two separate-thinking creatures.",
    "m_fslime_desc": "Slimes will eat just about anything they come across. These particular slimes have been eating something especially fiery in the caves, and have resultantly ended up being especially fiery themselves.",
    "m_fslime_note": "Causes burning on touch",
    "m_pslime_desc": "These dangerous creatures will poison you on hit, and also have a habit of tossing poisonous goop your way.",
    "m_pslime_note": "Fires poison projectiles and causes poison on touch",
    "m_bat_desc": "Bats pose little threat on their own, but can be dangerous in groups or while amongst other creatures.",
    "m_jumper_desc": "These hotheaded monsters are just angry with the world and everyone in it. They are more than happy to end their own lives in order to cause suffering to others. These creatures have many names throughout the world: Todgers, Chubbers, Yogurt Slingers, Porkers, Dongers, and many more! Perhaps their anger with the world is linked to the fact that they have so many derogatory nicknames.",
    "m_hobgoblin_desc": "Hobgoblins are renowned for their stupidity, but these mischievous little creatures are often very skilled in crafting. They wear handcrafted skull masks to cover up their horrendously unattractive faces, as well as wristlets and other jewelery which all indicate their social standing. Contrary to popular belief, hobgoblins are actually entirely unrelated to goblins.",
    "m_warrior_hob_desc": "Although most hobgoblins are atrocious warriors, there are a select few which become known as great champions. They are very strong, and can take quite a beating, but can be very easily outsmarted and outmaneuvered.",
    "m_kullo_desc": "These creatures are thought to be the remains of an ancient civilization, living on even after death. They have a powerful bite and are usually surrounded by mini kullos which will attempt to hunt you down if you destroy their guardian.",
    "m_draze_desc": "Drazes are similar to bats in appearance, but have one major difference - their ability to breath fire. Their ability to rain an inferno down upon you is extremely dangerous. You should try to keep a suitable distance between yourself and the mouth of a draze at all times.",
    "m_draze_note": "Causes Burning",
    "m_mushmn_desc": "Being quite unthreatening on their own, Mushm'ns tend to stick together in their squads. They throw sticky mushroom spores to slow down their targets, then proceed to claw at the throats and drink the delicious blood that pours out.",
    "m_goblin_desc": "Goblins are short & vicious creatures governed by orcs. Historically, they lived deep underground and developed massively oversized ears & giant yellow eyes which aided their ability to survive in the dark. Nowadays they are more integrated in to orcish culture and often live as a minority group in orcish camps & cities.",
    "m_orc_desc": "Orcs are large, strong, intelligent creatures who have been at war with humans for hundreds of years. They are savage warriors, with a taste for human flesh who enjoy nothing more than a good old fashioned raid.",
    "m_chief_orc_desc": "These orcs are much stronger than the regular ones, but don't tend to use ranged weapons. They have a very powerful swipe, so keep them at range!",
    "m_demon_orc_desc": "Orcs sometimes feel the need to make deals with the devil, resulting in these monstrosities who are very proficient in combat, but have absolutely zero personality.\n\nThese guys will block almost anything you throw at them and need to be attacked from behind.",
    "m_pitboy_desc": "Pitboys are a group of crazed men living within the cave, or the 'pit' as they perfer to call it.\n\nThey paint their skin various colours to determine rank within their groups, and often paint skeletal marking on their bodies to display their loyalty for their God, The Overlord.",
    "m_phantom_desc": "Having been brought in from the spirit world through the use of a powerful relic, phantoms are hostile characters who carry powerful shadow weapons.\n\nPhantoms resemble who they once were, but their bodies are gone. They are made up of an almost-solid, translucent substance which gives off a chilling aura.",
    "m_archfiend_desc": "Archfiends are powerful phantoms very rarely seen outside of the spirit world.\n\nThey feed on souls of the living, and use their mouth tentacles to suck the life out of their prey.",
    "m_cave_troll_desc": "These ugly creatures have very tough skin, making them quite resistant to ranged attacks. Trolls are fairly unintelligent creatures, and lead a simple life in caves throughout the world. They will eat just about anything, including rocks, metal and plants, but seem to have a particular hankering for humans.",
    "m_tiki_grub_desc": "These very territorial creatures will defend their land to the very end. They will undoubtably beat you at range - best practice is to duck and weave until you're close enough to hack away at them and interrupt their attacks.",
    "m_charger_desc": "Their rather unimaginative name comes from their incessant habit of charging down their enemies with a horrifying spiked shield. Avoiding their charge will leave them open to attack from behind.",
    "m_tentabrain_desc": "Tentabrains begin life as minute parasitic creatures floating through the air looking for a host to feed from. Eventually, they grow large enough to engulf entire chunks of land and remain stationary as they devour passing creatures.",
    "m_lava_swarm_desc": "A swarm of bee-like creatures which pack a powerful punch. They will use themselves as weapons in order to protect the swarm from incoming threats.",
    "m_spike_slug_desc": "A slimy creature with sharp spines protruding out of holes in their bodies. When threatened, spike slugs are able to propel a flurry of spines in to the air which are very difficult to avoid.\n\nSpike slugs are slow creatures with a sticky underside which allows them to slide along floors, walls and ceilings.",
    "m_splort_desc": "These bumblebee-like creatures seem to be very common in the Shrouded Land. They are extremely aggressive, and will charge at nearby threats to scare them off.\n\nIf their charge is dodged and they end up slamming in to a wall, they will be temporarily stunned leaving them open to attack.",
    "m_squidclops_desc": "Harmless flying cephalopods which use their tentacles to propel themselves in to the air.\n\nThese critters will periodically send out bursts of energy that will produce shields for nearby allies.",
    "m_crusher_desc": "These spiky fellas have a hard protective shell. They cannot be damaged until their shell is broken, revealing their vulnerable, but still just as spiky, flesh underneath.\n\nCrushers will charge down opponents at great speed. Due to their shape they will only charge in straight lines, so their movements can be easily predicted.",

    "m_medusa_desc": "Moonjellies never stop growing throughout their lifetime. Medusa has grown to an enormous size and now lives out her days in hiding protecting her young. She exhibits powerful lightning attacks and will do just about anything to protect her little bambino moonjellies.\n\nShe leaves herself vulnerable to attack after missing her slam attack.",
    "m_azguard_desc": "A hellish demonic beast who uses thick shielding to protect his vulnerable flesh.\n\nAzguard conjures magical bolts to propel towards his foes.\n\nVulnerable to melee attacks, and leaves himself open to attack after his slam attack.",
